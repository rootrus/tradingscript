If we going to long or short - For a week
dont do that when money flow is red or green


What is a 4 hours trigger wave (Green dot)
- If any green dot prints at 4 hour time frame that is printing a higher low from the last wave (that is call a trigger wave)
- If money flow is the red and we print a big green dot at the bottom 


If the money flow on the red and we get a big double green dot. its a powerful signal. It indicate that we hit a bottom. 
--- Looking for a long position. Only when the money flow just about to flow into the green and the green dot appear .
